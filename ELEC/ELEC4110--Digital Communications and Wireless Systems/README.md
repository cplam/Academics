## Disclaim of the cheatsheet
The cheatsheet I committed can be used in midterm. However for the post-midterm topics, starting for M9-fading. I do not have enough time to include every details in lecture notes in my cheatsheet, many techniques and proves are missing which will be tested in the final exam TF and MCQ. Please be careful if u directly use it :P.
